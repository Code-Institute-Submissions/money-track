# money-track


# Sorry I am not able to do this part as I didnt have time and gitpod says that im out of workspace so I dont know how can i check and sort out my project.
# The app looks good when I was doing it but when it was deployed to heroku, it didnt look as what i did and im not sure what to do.
# Just to give you a preview on the app, basically its called money track where users can create an account, log in and log out and will be able to use the account unfortunately i was having problems doing the authentication part of user, i wanted to send users verification email to activate their account but i wasnt able to do it so i didnt include it. Users can still sign up and use the app to track their expenses and salary. they can also add, edit and delete their expenses and salary. it has a expense summery and salary summary which used chart.js and was working fine before deploying to heroku. theres also a feature where users can export their data as csv, excel and pdf but its not showing on the deployed project on heroku so i dont know where i went wrong. i was really happy with the app but unfortunately im sure i did somthing wrong thats why it didnt deploy properly on heroku. please let me know what to do about this, was trying to contact student or tutor support but the earliest call appointment will be next week which is pass the submission due date.
